Pizza Meny App

This is a React application for a pizza menu. I've structured the app using reusable components:

Header: Displays the name of the pizza company.
Menu: Lists all the pizzas, with each one represented by a Pizza component.
Pizza: Shows individual pizza details, including the name, ingredients, and an image.
Footer: Dynamically shows whether the store is currently open based on the time.
I've also added basic styling to these components using both inline styles and an external CSS file (index.css).
